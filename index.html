            <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
                <br>
                <p> Some say the world will end in fire,
                    Some say in ice.
                    From what I’ve tasted of desire
                    I hold with those who favor fire.
                    But if it had to perish twice,
                    I think I know enough of hate
                    To say that for destruction ice
                    Is also great
                    And would suffice. </p>

            <h1>A Life Well Lived</h1>
                <br>
                <p> A life well lived is a precious gift
                    Of hope and strength and grace,
                    From someone who has made our world
                    A brighter, better place
                    It’s filled with moments, sweet and sad
                    With smiles and sometimes tears,
                    With friendships formed and good times shared
                    And laughter through the years.
                    A life well lived is a legacy
                    Of joy and pride and pleasure,
                    A living, lasting memory
                    Our grateful hearts we’ll treasure </p>

            <h1>Hurt And Pain</h1>
                <br>
                <p> There's much to gain.
                    Peace and love.
                    It's all the same.
                    Confusion and doubt.
                    We're not without.
                    We weep, we cry.
                    We plead, we try.
                    We laugh, we smile.
                    Only to be hurt
                    by one last trial.
                    Life is a lesson,
                    so learn it well.
                    Maybe, one day,
                    you can tell it's tale.
